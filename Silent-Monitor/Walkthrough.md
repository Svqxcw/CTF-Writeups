### 📡 Initial Reconnaissance

1. Started off with some passive recon by throwing the target IP straight into the browser, but no luck here — the page just refused to connect.

2. ### 🔍 Network Scanning & Service Discovery

I jumped straight into active scanning with Nmap to see what services were actually listening on the target.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV //machine_ip
